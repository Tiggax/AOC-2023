# Advent of Code 2023

Some of it is made in Rust and some in Nushell


## Nushell

The scripts are a module, that you can just test using the test input:

```nushell
use std testing run-tests
run-tests
```
in the directory or just simply run on your data by:

```nushell
use part1.nu
part1.nu  
```
